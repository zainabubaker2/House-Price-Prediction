# HousePricePrediction

## Target Audience:
Programmers who have an interest in Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms, "Scikit learn" library, the implementation of cross-validation, and data cleaning.

## Objective:
The aim of this project is to predict houses' or apartments' prices based on previous features observed throughout a phase of time, and on different instances of houses. The given example at the Dataset section shows clear example of such features.


## Requirements:
* To run the code, you have to have any type of compiler that could run an ".ipynb" file, I strongly suggest Anaconda's "Jupyter Notebook" or "Microsoft Visual Code"
* For used tools, it's preferable if you use python version that's 3.7 or newer.
* After installing python, for tools installation, go to cmd, and write:
```
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install scipy 
pip install sklearn
pip install matplotlib
pip install pickle
pip install seaborn
pip install pprint

```

## Dataset:
I've used a Kaggle Dataset, which could be found at [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)!
